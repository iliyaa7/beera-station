Before commiting you need to check if the idenfySDK Target version and build is incremented by one.

After that make a STAGE_SDK-* Tag. Commit if needed before the tag. Push the updates. Wait for the build result.

If the build is successful, test it locally with using testing branch. If everything is alright, tag it PROD_SDK-* and push new tag. Wait for the deployment.
